        Let's start by creating a simple page that contains the phrase "Hello, World!" in the body. The page will also have a title - that thing that shows up in the title of the tab in your browser. The <title> element defines the title of the HTML page.

The  element defines a "paragraph", a block of text that has a small amount of spacing in between its top and bottom.

Notice how the tags have a start tag and an end tag denoted with a slash. Everything in between is the content of the tag. The content of a tag can usually have additional HTML tags within them.
